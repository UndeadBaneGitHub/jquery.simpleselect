#jQuery.SimpleSelect

Have you ever faced a situation, when you desperately need to open <select> programmaticaly, but you can't?
Or next, you need to style the list items in some specific way, but all the plugins you've tried so far (and you've tested a LOT by now) just do not allow that because, well, hardcoding styles rules?

Or, maybe, you just need a search and filter, attached to your select as it is HUGE?
Or you are in need of autocomplete that does not act wonky (as, let's be honest, most of them do)?

And you need all of that as SIMPLE as possible - everyone does. Well, I used to be such a person - and I had to write this plugin.
Welcome, feel like at home!
